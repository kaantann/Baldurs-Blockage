# Baldur's Blockage

#### This hands-on project is a text-based role-playing game. Participants will have the opportunity to register for the game, employing the secure authentication provided by JSON web tokens. Once registered, users can unleash their creativity by crafting unique characters, whether it be a powerful mage mastering arcane spells or a formidable knight wielding a mighty sword.

#### Character customization goes beyond mere aesthetics, allowing users to enhance their creations with an arsenal of skills and weapons. Develop strategic combinations, hone distinct abilities, and personalize characters to suit individual playstyles.

#### The true excitement unfolds as characters enter the arena, engaging in thrilling battles to determine the ultimate champion. Witness the outcomes of strategic decisions and skillful maneuvering as characters clash in epic encounters.


##### Here are what I learnt : 
- Build a complete .NET 7 back-end with Web API, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server.
- Implement Token Authentication with JSON Web Tokens & Roles.
- Utilize all three types of relationships in your database: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
- Use generic HTTP request methods GET, POST, PUT & DELETE.
- Implement best practices like a proper structure for your Web API, Dependency Injection, asynchronous calls with async/await, and Data-Transfer-Objects (DTOs).
- Use LINQ to filter, sort, map, select and access your entities.
- Seed data with code-first migrations programmatically.
